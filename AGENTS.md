Hard-Cut Product Policy

- This application currently has no external installed user base; optimize for one canonical current-state implementation, not compatibility with historical local states.
- Do not preserve or introduce compatibility bridges, migration shims, fallback paths, compact adapters, or dual behavior for old local states unless the user explicitly asks for that support.
- Prefer:
- one canonical current-state codepath
- fail-fast diagnostics
- explicit recovery steps over:
- automatic migration
- compatibility glue
- silent fallbacks
- "temporary" second paths
- If temporary migration or compatibility code is introduced for debugging or a narrowly scoped transition, it must be called out in the same diff with:
- why it exists
  -why the canonical path is insufficient
- exact deletion criteria
- the ADR/task that tracks its removal
- Default stance across the app: delete old-state compatibility code rather than carrying it forward.
